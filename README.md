# Take-A-Trip
Take A Trip is a python fractal image viewer. This program can create several different fractal patterns using the turtle module.

Upon opening the user will be greeted with a background fractal image and several drop down menus. 

From the Fractals tab the user may select a fractal to view, such as Triangle or Tree.

From the Edit tab the user may currently clear (as in reset) the window and exit.

Currently Color Tabs do not properly work however line, fill, and background color may be choosen by changing the function argument of the fractal.
